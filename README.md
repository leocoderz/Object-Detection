#Realtime Object Detection

realtime object detection is made using opencv library in python.I have used YOLOv3-tiny algorithm that uses neural networks to provide real-time object detection.
the most popular coco dataset supplied to model.The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is one of the most popular open source object recognition databases used to train deep learning programs.The object detection helps us to identify the objects in realtime and mark object and displays name of objects.
